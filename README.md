# Plant-wide Control and Optimization of Steel Manufacturing Using Machine Learning for Fault Detection
Machine learning-based fault detection and process optimization in steel manufacturing using plant-wide sensor data.


This project was conducted as part of Purdue University's Smart Manufacturing course and focuses on developing a machine learning framework to detect and localize faults across a steel manufacturing plant.

## üí° Project Overview
- Designed a plant-wide optimization system using sensor data collected from multiple units.
- Implemented fault detection using unsupervised learning models such as PCA and Isolation Forest.
- Focused on early detection of anomalies in rolling, reheating, and continuous casting processes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Minitab
- JMP
- Process Control and Optimization
